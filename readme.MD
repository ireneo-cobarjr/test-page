# My Test Page
Nothing more than a simple set-up with gulp for browser-sync and sass compiling all via gulp. Useful for just testing something on a web page or for initial set-up of a project.

### To use this:
```
git clone https://github.com/ireneo-cobarjr/test-page.git
cd test-page
npm install
gulp
```
You may rename the root directory based on your needs.
